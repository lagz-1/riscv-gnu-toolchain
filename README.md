# riscv-gnu-toolchain

**This tutorial is for setting up the environment related to the riscv-gnu-toolchain, and it serves as the foundational environment setup for the MIT 6.S081 course**

***

## 1. Download the file riscv-gnu-toolchain.tar.gz to your ubuntu
  I have provided the download link for the file below, so you don't have to pull the mirror from GitHub (which can be subject to your internet speed and sometimes fail to fetch). 
  Once you download and unzip it on your Ubuntu, you can proceed with the *configuration* (../configure) and *compilation* (make) directly.
